INFORMED HER THAT THE APPEAL DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED HER LETTER OF
APPEAL AND THAT I HAVE CONTACTED UBH WHO DETERMINED THAT THIS REQUEST

WOULD LIKE AN EXPEDITED REVIEW.  I INFORMED MEMBER'S MOTHER THAT THE
MEETING WOULD BE TAKING PLACE POSSIBLY AT 1:00 PM TOMORROW (5/7/08).
MEMBER'S MOTHER STATED THAT SHE HAS ANOTHER MEETING TOMORROW WITH
BEHAVIORAL SPECIALISTS INC (BSI) AT 1:00 PM AND ASKED IF THE REVIEW
COULD BE HELD EARLIER.  I INFORMED MEMBER THAT I WOULD LOOK INTO TRYING
TO GET THE REVIEW SCHEDULED FOR 11:30 AM ON 5/7/08 AND I WOULD CALL HER
BACK.  I ALSO INFORMED MEMBER'S MOTHER THAT SHE MAY REQUEST THE AID OF

MEMBER'S MOTHER REQUESTED A COPY OF THE CASE FILE AND I STATED I WOULD
HAVE THIS COPY READY FOR HER AT THE MEETING 5/7/08.  MEMBER'S MOTHER
STATED THAT MEMBER REALLY NEEDS TO STAY IN THIS PROGRAM AT BSI BECAUSE
SHE IS NOTICING SOME IMPROVEMENT.  MEMBER'S MOTHER STATED THAT MEMBER
RECENTLY HIT HIS SISTER AND LEFT A SOFTBALL SIZE BRUISE ON HER LEG
BECAUSE HIS SISTER TOUCHED MEMBER WITH HER WET HAIR.  MEMBER'S MOTHER
STATED THAT BSI INFORMED HER THAT MEMBER WOULD NEED TO BE IN THEIR
PROGRAM 6-9 MONTHS AT LEAST.  MEMBER'S MOTHER STATED THAT MEMBER STARTED
HAVING PROBLEMS IN THIRD GRADE AND SHE HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET HELP FOR
HIM SINCE THEN.  LAST YEAR MEMBER HAD DETENTION EVERY WEEK BECAUSE OF
HIS BEHAVIOR IN SCHOOL.  MEMBER WAS RECENTLY EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL FOR
MAKING A BOMB THREAT AND THIS IS WHEN CHILDREN AND YOUTH RECOMMENDED

DRINKS ALL THE TIME HOWEVER MEMBER DOES NOT SEE A PROBLEM WITH THIS
SINCE THIS IS A NORMAL ROUTINE.  MEMBER'S MOTHER STATES THE MEMBER WAS
AFFECTED THROUGH HER VIOLENT MARRIAGE WITH HIS FATHER AND MEMBER HAS
ALSO WITNESS HIS FATHER BEATING HIS STEP-MOTHER.  MEMBER'S MOTHER STATES
THAT THINGS HAVE HAPPENED TO MEMBER WHILE HE HAS HIS VISITATION WITH HIS
FATHER.  MEMBER HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL ONE TIME AND HIS FATHER WOULD
NOT TAKE HIM SO HIS MOTHER WAS CALLED AND TOOK HIM FOR TREATMENT BECAUSE
HE HAD WRECKED ON HIS BIKE.  MEMBER'S FATHER IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH
ANOTHER DIVORCE AND NOW HAS A NEW GIRLFRIEND AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE
MEMBER HOWEVER, MEMBER DOES NOT WANT TO GO WITH HIS FATHER.  MEMBER'S
MOTHER STATED THAT SHE IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH THE COURT FOR MORE
THAN PRIMARY CUSTODY.  MEMBER'S MOTHER STATED MEDICAL ASSISTANCE WILL
NOT COVER THIS BECAUSE IT WAS DENIED BY UBH AS NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY.
MEMBER'S MOTHER STATED SHE IS READY TO QUIT HER JOB SO SHE WON'T HAVE
GHP AS HER PRIMARY INSURANCE AND THEN MEMBER WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE
MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.  MEMBER'S MOTHER STATED THAT MEMBER NEEDS THIS HELPO
I AGAIN INFORMED MEMBER'S MOTHER THAT I WILL CONTACT HER AT 16095 TO
